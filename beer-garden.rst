Automate More, Worry Less with Beer Garden
==========================================

Description
-----------

Do you have Custom python scripts that are super powerful sitting
in your home directory? You want to share them with end-users, 
developers and teammates alike, but you know **there is a mountain 
of work between your scripts and a service you can share with 
others.** Beer Garden makes that transition as smooth as two sips
from your favorite beverage.

In this talk, we’ll take a simple script, and make it **production 
ready in 5 lines of code**. Our script will become a fully-backed 
REST Interface, web GUI, tracing and metrics without us breaking a 
sweat. Since one script does not a startup make, we’ll also tie 
two scripts together and show how Beer Garden lets you keep 
automating without the worry.

After this talk, I hope you’ll be inspired to convert the scripts 
that **help you** get things done into scripts that **help your entire 
team**, from other engineers, to end-users, get things done.

Audience
--------

This talked is aimed at people who use python as a way to improve 
their current work experience. A full software development 
background is not required to enjoy this talk, but basic 
understanding of syntax will help follow the demos.

If any of the following sound like you, this is the talk for you:

* I can write a script, but I’m not a developer
* I have lots of useful scripts that I wish more people could use
* I wish I had a standard way to call many (and even legacy) systems
* I want to help my team, but can’t take the time to write a full 
  REST interface and Web GUI


Outline

**Meet Jordan (and me)** - 5 min

* Jordan likes to get things done.
* Jordan works from a ticket queue and frequently works with 5 
  different services.
* Jordan gets asked questions from end-users, teammates, and 
  internal software development teams because of his domain 
  knowledge

Additional Notes
----------------

This would be my first time speaking at a conference like PyCon, 
and I’m very excited at the opportunity.  I plan on taking this 
talk to my local user’s group before PyCon to practice and 
receive feedback.

All of the live demos only rely on my local laptop and no internet 
connection is required. However, I will have back up videos in case 
something terrible happens and I can’t demo even on localhost.
